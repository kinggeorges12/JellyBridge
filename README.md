## Features

- **Scheduled Tasks**: Automatically syncs movies and series on a configurable schedule and on Jellyfin startup
- **Library Management**: Prevents placeholder movies and series from appearing in main libraries
- **Fine-grained Libraries**: Option to create separate directories for each network allowing you to group them into libraries
- **Smart Exclusion**: Uses native Jellyfin configuration files to exclude movies and series that already exist in your other Jellyfin libraries

## Jellyfin Integration

The plugin integrates seamlessly with Jellyfin, displaying discovered content as placeholder videos that users can browse and mark as favorites to request downloads.

Get Jellyfin here: [jellyfin.org](https://jellyfin.org/). For setup, see the official [installation guide](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/).

Browse all discovered movies and series from Jellyseerr networks with thumbnails and metadata.

### Placeholder Videos

The plugin generates placeholder videos for movies and series that aren't yet available in your Jellyfin libraries. These placeholder videos are created using FFmpeg with configurable duration settings.

![Placeholder Videos](Screenshots/Placeholder.png)

- **Smart Detection**: Jellyfin automatically identifies and displays placeholder videos
- **Automatic Generation**: Creates placeholder videos for movies and series not yet in your Jellyfin library
- **Configurable Duration**: Control the length of placeholder videos
- **Retry Logic**: Includes retry attempts to ensure FFmpeg availability before generating placeholders
- **Efficient Caching**: Cached placeholder videos are reused to minimize generation overhead

### Jellyseerr Integration

The plugin seamlessly integrates with Jellyseerr to manage download requests and track availability of movies and series.

![Jellyseerr Requests](Screenshots/Requests.png)

When users mark movies or series as favorites in Jellyfin, the plugin automatically sends download requests to Jellyseerr for processing. The user who requested the content is shown in Jellyseerr as the requestor, all you have to do is import the Jellyfin users. Any integrations with Jellyseerr like Radarr and Sonarr will manage the content creation in Jellyfin. After content is found in other Jellyfin libraries, the movie or series is hidden from the JellyBridge library.

Get Jellyseerr here: [seerr.dev](https://seerr.dev). For setup, see the official [installation guide](https://docs.seerr.dev/getting-started).
