# JellyBridge Plugin

A Jellyfin plugin that bridges Jellyfin with Jellyseerr for seamless movie and series discovery and download requests.

**üôè A Note to Early Testers**: Thank you! I have fixed a lot of bugs on the backend with the v1.3.0.* release, and some new features! I hope the flurry of issues does not stop you from checking out the new release. I tested this release on both 10.10.7 and 10.11.1 releases. Please continue submitting issues with new feature ideas and reporting bugs.

After installing the new version, you must update the plugin page using these instructions:
`Jellyfin uses caching for the plugin configuration pages, so you may need to do a hard refresh of the page to see the latest changes. In Chrome, Open Developer Tools (F12) ‚Üí Right-click Refresh button ‚Üí "Empty Cache and Hard Reload".`

## Features

- **Native Jellyfin Support**: Whether you use Android TV or Kodi to sync videos and favorites with Jellyfin, this plugin has you covered
- **Make Jellyseerr Requests**: Enables requesting new movies and series directly from a Jellyfin library, making this accessible from mobile apps, Android TV, and even Kodi Sync Queue!
- **Automated Content Listing**: Automatically lists movies and series from various networks (Netflix, Prime Video, etc.) within Jellyfin as placeholders
- **Easy Downloads**: Sends downloads to Arr apps through Jellyseerr media requests when you mark movies or series as favorites in Jellyfin
- **Configure Network Discovery**: Allows selection of networks to fetch and display in Jellyfin
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Automatically syncs movies and series on a configurable schedule and on Jellyfin startup
- **Library Management**: Prevents placeholder movies and series from appearing in main libraries
- **Fine-grained Libraries**: Option to create separate directories for each network allowing you to group them into libraries
- **Smart Exclusion**: Uses native Jellyfin configuration files to exclude movies and series that already exist in your other Jellyfin libraries

## Jellyfin Integration

The plugin integrates seamlessly with Jellyfin, displaying discovered content as placeholder videos that users can browse and mark as favorites to request downloads.

Get Jellyfin here: [jellyfin.org](https://jellyfin.org/). For setup, see the official [installation guide](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/).

### Library View
![Jellyfin Library](Screenshots/Library.png)

The plugin manages libraries and folders in Jellyfin, creating structure for discovered content.

### Items View
![Jellyfin Items with Placeholders](Screenshots/Items.png)

Browse all discovered movies and series from Jellyseerr networks with thumbnails and metadata.

Note: By default, Jellyfin uses *Sort by Folders* ‚Üë which appears to show only Series in the Discover library. This is not the case! The recommended setting is to use *Critics rating* (descending).

### Placeholder Videos

The plugin generates placeholder videos for movies and series that aren't yet available in your Jellyfin libraries. These placeholder videos are created using FFmpeg with configurable duration settings.

![Placeholder Videos](Screenshots/Placeholder.png)

- **Smart Detection**: Jellyfin automatically identifies and displays placeholder videos
- **Automatic Generation**: Creates placeholder videos for movies and series not yet in your Jellyfin library
- **Configurable Duration**: Control the length of placeholder videos
- **Retry Logic**: Includes retry attempts to ensure FFmpeg availability before generating placeholders
- **Efficient Caching**: Cached placeholder videos are reused to minimize generation overhead

### Jellyseerr Integration

The plugin seamlessly integrates with Jellyseerr to manage download requests and track availability of movies and series.

![Jellyseerr Requests](Screenshots/Requests.png)

When users mark movies or series as favorites in Jellyfin, the plugin automatically sends download requests to Jellyseerr for processing. The user who requested the content is shown in Jellyseerr as the requestor, all you have to do is import the Jellyfin users. Any integrations with Jellyseerr like Radarr and Sonarr will manage the content creation in Jellyfin. After content is found in other Jellyfin libraries, the movie or series is hidden from the JellyBridge library.

Get Jellyseerr here: [seerr.dev](https://seerr.dev). For setup, see the official [installation guide](https://docs.seerr.dev/getting-started).

After installing Jellyseerr, disable the JellyBridge library to prevent requests from being marked as Available.

3. **Configure the plugin** through the admin interface

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the plugin ZIP file from the [releases](../../releases)
2. Extract the contents to your Jellyfin plugins directory
3. Restart Jellyfin
4. Configure the plugin through the web interface

## Configuration

Access the plugin configuration from the host machine at: `http://localhost:8096/web/#/configurationpage?name=JellyBridge`

### Usage

The plugin includes a modern, responsive web interface for configuration. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Configure the plugin** through the web interface with your Jellyseerr credentials and directory paths
2. **Create JellyBridge Library** in Jellyfin with the options suggested on the plugin configuration page
3. **Test the connection** to ensure Jellyseerr is accessible
4. **Enable the plugin** and trigger an initial sync
5. **Mark movies or series as favorites** in Jellyfin to automatically request downloads

The plugin provides a comprehensive web-based configuration interface with the following sections:

### Main Configuration

![Plugin Configuration - General Settings](Screenshots/General.png)

- **Jellyseerr URL**: The web address where your Jellyseerr instance is running
- **API Key**: Authentication key that allows the plugin to communicate with Jellyseerr
- **Library Directory**: Where JellyBridge stores placeholder videos and metadata files on your system. Placeholder videos are short video files that represent content not yet downloaded. Metadata files contain information about movies and shows.
- **Enable Plugin**: Turns on automatic syncing on a schedule. Syncing transfers content information between Jellyseerr and Jellyfin.
- **Sync Interval**: How often the plugin automatically syncs content, measured in hours.
- **Test Connection**: Verifies that the plugin can successfully connect to your Jellyseerr instance

### üìÅ Favorite Settings

![Favorite Settings](Screenshots/Favorite.png)

- **Manage Jellyseerr Library**: Automatically refreshes your JellyBridge library in Jellyfin after each sync to show newly added or updated content. Performs a quick refresh for new items, or a full refresh if content was removed from Jellyseerr.
- **Exclude from Main Libraries**: Prevents duplicate content by hiding movies and shows in the JellyBridge library if they already exist in your other Jellyfin libraries.
- **Remove requested items from favorites**: Automatically removes items from everyone's favorites list once they've been successfully requested in Jellyseerr, and hides them from the library. This prevents conflicts with other plugins like <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stefanbohacek/MediaCleaner">Media Cleaner for Jellyfin</a>. If the request is denied in Jellyseerr, the item will reappear on the next sync.
- **Create Separate Libraries**: Creates individual libraries for each streaming service instead of one combined library.
- **Library Prefix**: Text added to the beginning of library names when creating separate libraries for each streaming service.

### üîç Discover Settings

![Discover Settings](Screenshots/Discover.png)

- **Max Discover Pages**: Controls how much discover content is pulled from each network during sync. Discover content includes available movies and shows from streaming networks. Each page contains 20 items. Applies to both movies and TV shows.
- **Max Retention Days**: How long to keep discover content in the library before automatically removing it. Older items are cleaned up during sync.
- **Region**: Which geographic region to use for discovering streaming content. Different regions show different available networks.
- **Network Services**: Choose which streaming networks to pull content from and include in your library.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Settings

![Advanced Settings](Screenshots/Advanced.png)
- **Auto Sync on Startup**: Automatically runs a sync when the plugin starts or when Jellyfin restarts.
- **Startup Delay**: How many seconds to wait before running the startup sync, in addition to Jellyfin's built-in 1-minute delay.
- **Request Timeout**: How long to wait for responses from Jellyseerr before considering the request failed.
- **Retry Attempts**: How many times to retry failed requests to Jellyseerr before giving up.
- **Placeholder Duration**: How long the placeholder videos should be, in seconds. Placeholder videos are short video files created for movies and shows that aren't yet available in your library, allowing them to appear in Jellyfin.
- **Enable Debug Logging**: Provides more detailed information in the logs to help troubleshoot issues.

Note: The Advanced section also includes a destructive action "Recycle Jellyfin Library Data" to purge all generated JellyBridge data from the configured library directory. Use with extreme caution and recreate the Jellyfin library afterward as instructed in the UI.

## Logging & Troubleshooting

The plugin integrates with Jellyfin's logging system. Enable debug logging from the advanced options to record detailed logs. Check Jellyfin logs for debugging information:

- Plugin initialization and configuration
- API calls to Jellyseerr
- Series sync operations
- Library management
- Error messages and warnings
